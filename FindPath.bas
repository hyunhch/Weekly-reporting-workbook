' COMMENTS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION:
' 1)    Adding the MountPoints from the registry is not the best solution for
'       many reasons.
'       Most importantly, the registry is just not available on Mac.
'       Also, in various cases these registry keys can contain mistakes, like
'       for example when:
'       1. Synchronizing a folder called "Personal" from someone else's personal
'          OneDrive
'       2. Synchronizing a folder called "Business1" from someone else's
'          personal OneDrive and then relogging your own first Business OneDrive
'       3. Relogging you own personal OneDrive can change the "CID" property
'          from a folderID formatted cid (e.g. 3DEA8A9886F05935!125) to a
'          regular private cid (e.g. 3dea8a9886f05935) for synced folders
'          from other people's OneDrives
'
'       Also, even if we assume the information from the registry is correct,
'       it just doesn't contain enough information to solve all possible cases.
'       This is why this function builds the Web to Local translation dictionary
'       by extracting the MountPoints from the OneDrive settings files.
'
' 2)    This function reads the following files from
'       On Windows:
'           - the "...\AppData\Local\Microsoft" directory
'       On Mac:
'           - the ".../Library/Containers/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac/Data/" & _
'                 "Library/Application Support/OneDrive" directory
'
'       (* is a wildcard representing 0 or more characters, ? is a
'       wildcard representing a character, # is a wildcard representing a digit
'       The ???... filenames represent cids):
'       \OneDrive\settings\Personal\ClientPolicy.ini
'       \OneDrive\settings\Personal\????????????????.dat
'       \OneDrive\settings\Personal\????????????????.ini
'       \OneDrive\settings\Personal\global.ini
'       \OneDrive\settings\Personal\GroupFolders.ini
'       \OneDrive\settings\Business#\????????-????-????-????-????????????.dat
'       \OneDrive\settings\Business#\????????-????-????-????-????????????.ini
'       \OneDrive\settings\Business#\ClientPolicy*.ini
'       \OneDrive\settings\Business#\global.ini
'       \Office\CLP\* (just the filename)
'
'       On mac, the \Office\CLP\* exists for each Microsoft Office application
'       separately. Depending on whether the application was already used in
'       active syncing with OneDrive it may contain different/incomplete files.
'       In the code, the path of this directory is stored inside the variable
'       "clpPath". On Mac, the defined clpPath might not exist or not contain
'       all necessary files for some host applications, because Environ("HOME")
'       depends on the host app.
'       This is not a big problem as the function will still work, however in
'       this case, specifying a preferredMountPointOwner will do nothing.
'       To make sure this directory and the necessary files exist, a file must
'       have been actively synchronized with OneDrive by the application whose
'       "HOME" folder is returned by Environ("HOME") while being logged in
'       to that application with the account whose email is given as
'       preferredMountPointOwner, at some point in the past!
'
'       If you are usually working with Excel but are using this function in a
'       different app, you can instead use an alternative (Excels CLP folder) as
'       the clpPath as it will most likely contain all the necessary information
'       The alternative clpPath is commented out in the code, if you prefer to
'       use Excels CLP folder per default, just un-comment the respective line
'       in the code.
'*******************************************************************************

'*******************************************************************************
' COMMENTS REGARDING THE USAGE:
' This function can be used as a User Defined Function (UDF) from the worksheet.
'
' This function offers three optional parameters to the user, however using
' these should only be necessary in extremely rare situations. The best rule
' regarding their usage: Don't use them.
'
' In the following these parameters will still be explained.
'
'1) rebuildCache
'   The function creates a "translation" dictionary from the OneDrive settings
'   files and then uses this dictionary to "translate" WebPaths to LocalPaths.
'   This dictionary is implemented as a static variable to the function doesn't
'   have to recreate it every time it is called. It is written on the first
'   function call and reused on all the subsequent calls, making them faster.
'   If the function is called with rebuildCache:=True, this dictionary will be
'   rewritten, even if it was already initialized.
'   Note that it is not necessary to use this parameter manually, even if a new
'   MountPoint was added to the OneDrive, or a new OneDrive account was logged
'   in since the last function call because the function will automatically
'   determine if any of those cases occurred, without sacrificing performance.
'
'2) returnAll
'   In some exceptional cases it is possible to map one OneDrive WebPath to
'   multiple different localPaths. This can happen when multiple Business
'   OneDrive accounts are logged in on the device, and multiple of these have
'   access to the same OneDrive folder and they both decide to synchronize it or
'   add it as link to their MySite library.
'   Calling the function with returnAll:=True will return all valid localPaths
'   for the given WebPath, separated by two forward slashes (//). This should be
'   used with caution, as the return value of the function alone is, should
'   multiple local paths exist for the input webPath, not a valid local path
'   anymore.
'   An example of how to obtain all of the local paths could look like this:
'   Dim localPath as String, localPaths() as String
'   localPath = GetLocalPath(webPath, False, True)
'   If Not localPath Like "http*" Then
'       localPaths = Split(localPath, "//")
'   End If
'
'3) preferredMountPointOwner
'   This argument deals with the same problem as 'returnAll'
'   If the function gets called with returnAll:=False (default), and multiple
'   localPaths exist for the given WebPath, the function will just return any
'   one of them, as usually, it shouldn't make a difference, because the result
'   directories at both of these localPaths are mirrored versions of the same
'   webPath. Nevertheless, this option lets the user choose, which mountPoint
'   should be chosen if multiple localPaths are available. Each localPath is
'  'owned' by an OneDrive Account. If a WebPath is synchronized twice, this can
'   only happen by synchronizing it with two different accounts, because
'   OneDrive prevents you from synchronizing the same folder twice on a single
'   account. Therefore, each of the different localPaths for a given WebPath
'   has a unique 'owner'. preferredMountPointOwner lets the user select the
'   localPath by specifying the account the localPath should be owned by.
'   This is done by passing the Email address of the desired account as
'   preferredMountPointOwner.
'   For example, you have two different Business OneDrive accounts logged in,
'   foo.bar@business1.com and foo.bar@business2.com
'   Both synchronize the WebPath:
'   webPath = "https://business1.sharepoint.com/sites/TestLib/Documents/" & _
              "Test/Test/Test/test.xlsm"
'
'   The first one has added it as a link to his personal OneDrive, the local
'   path looks like this:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm
'
'   The second one just synchronized it normally, the localPath looks like this:
'   C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\test.xlsm
'
'   Calling GetLocalPath like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath,,, "foo.bar@business1.com") will return:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm
'
'   Calling it like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath,,, "foo.bar@business2.com") will return:
'   C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\test.xlsm
'
'   And calling it like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath,, True) will return:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm//C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\...
'   ...test.xlsm
'
'   Calling it normally like this:
'   GetLocalPath(webPath) will return any one of the two localPaths, so:
'   C:\Users\username\OneDrive - Business1\TestLinkParent\Test - TestLinkLib\...
'   ...Test\test.xlsm
'   OR
'   C:\Users\username\Business1\TestLinkLib - Test\Test\test.xlsm
